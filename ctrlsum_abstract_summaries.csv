roberta," we present a new approach to training a language model that achieves state - of - the - art results on various benchmarks. our approach is based on training the language model with a set of training data, and then training the language model using the language model"," we present the results of a systematic study of the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size on the performance of our best model, which achieves state - of - the - art results on various benchmarks."," in this paper we present our best model, which achieves state - of - the - art results on the compass benchmark, and is significantly outperformed by all models published after it."
albert," in this paper, we present two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of the well - known @xmath0-transformation of the english language. empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale"," in this paper, we present two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of the well - known @xmath0-transformation of the english language. we also use a self -supervised loss that focuses on"," in this paper, we present two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of the well - known @xmath0-transformation of the english language. we also use a self -supervised loss that focuses on"
