<S0>For the pedestrian observer, financial markets look completely random with erratic and uncontrollable behavior.</S0> <S1> To a large extend, this is correct.</S1> <S2>At first approximation the difference between real price changes and the random walk model is too small to be detected using traditional time series analysis.</S2> <S3> However, we show in the following that this difference between real financial time series and random walks, as small as it is, is detectable using modern statistical multivariate analysis, with several triggers encoded in trading systems.</S3> <S4> This kind of analysis are based on methods widely used in nuclear physics, with large samples of data and advanced statistical inference.</S4> <S5> Considering the movements of the Euro future contract at high frequency, we show that a part of the non-random content of this series can be inferred, namely the trend-following content depending on volatility ranges.<S5>

<S0>In this paper we develop an algorithm for peak load reduction to reduce the impact of increased air conditioner usage in a residential smart grid community.</S0> <S1> We develop Demand Response Management (DRM) plans that clearly spell out the maximum duration as well as maximum severity of inconvenience.</S1> <S2> We model the air conditioner as a power throttling device and for any given DRM plan we study the impact of increasing the number of power states on the resulting peak load reduction.</S2> <S3> Through simulations, we find out that adding just one additional state to the basic ON/OFF model, which can throttle power to 50% of the rated air conditioner power, can result in significant amount of peak reduction.</S3> <S4> However, the peak load that can be reduced is diminishing with the increas e in number of states.</S4> <S5> Furthermore, we also observe the impact of inconvenience duration and inconvenience severity in terms of peak load reduction.</S5> <S6> These observations can serve as useful guidelines for developing appropriate DRM plans.</S6>

<S0>Edge detection is a classic problem in the field of image processing, which lays foundations for other tasks such as image segmentation.</S0> <S1> Conventionally, this operation is performed using gradient operators such as the Roberts or Sobel operator, which can discover local changes in intensity levels.</S1> <S2> These operators, however, perform poorly on low contrast images.</S2> <S3> In this paper, we propose an edge detector architecture for color images based on fuzzy theory and the Sobel operator.</S3> <S4> First, the R, G and B channels are extracted from an image and enhanced using fuzzy methods, in order to suppress noise and improve the contrast between the background and the objects.</S4> <S5> The Sobel operator is then applied to each of the channels, which are finally combined into an edge map of the origin image.</S5> <S6> Experimental results obtained through an FPGA-based implementation have proved the proposed method effective.</S6>

<S0>We consider the problem of rate allocation among multiple simultaneous video streams sharing multiple heterogeneous access networks.</S0> <S1> We develop and evaluate an analytical framework for optimal rate allocation based on observed available bit rate (ABR) and round-trip time (RTT) over each access network and video distortion-rate (DR) characteristics.</S1> <S2> The rate allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total expected distortion of all video streams.</S2> <S3> We present a distributed approximation of its solution and compare its performance against H ∞-optimal control and two heuristic schemes based on TCP-style additive-increase-multiplicativedecrease (AIMD) principles.</S3> <S4> The various rate allocation schemes are evaluated in simulations of multiple high-definition (HD) video streams sharing multiple access networks.</S4> <S5> Our result s demonstrate that, in comparison with heuristic AIMD-based schemes, both media-aware allocation and H ∞-optimal control benefit from proactive congestion avoidance and reduce the average packet loss rate from 45% to below 2%.</S5> <S6> Improvement in average received video quality ranges between 1.5 to 10.7 dB in PSNR for various background traffic loads and video playou t deadlines.</S6> <S7> Media-aware allocation further exploits its knowledge of the video DR characteristics to achieve a more balanced video quality among all streams.</S7>

<S0>The summation of logarithmic contributions to perturbative radiative corrections in physical processes through use of the renormalization group equation has proved to be a useful way of enhancing the information one can obtain from explicit calculation.</S0> <S1> However, it has proved difficult to perform this summation when massive fields are present.</S1> <S2> In this note we point out that if the masses involved are quite large, the decoupling theorem of Symanzik and of Appelquist and Carazzone can be used to make the summation of logarithms possible.</S2>

<S0>In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the network entropy for consensus dynamics in classical or quantum networks.</S0> <S1> We show that in the classical case, the network entropy decreases at the consensus limit if the node initial values are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, and the network differential entropy is monotonically non-increasing if the node initial values are i.i.d. Gaussian.</S1> <S2> While for quantum consensus dynamics, the network’s von Neumann entropy is in contrast non-decreasing.</S2> <S3> In light of this inconsistency, we compare several gossiping algorithms with random or deterministic coefficients for classical or quantum networks, and show that quantum gossiping algorithms with deterministic coefficients are physically related to classical gossiping algorithms with random coefficients.</S3>

<S0>Stable self-trapped vortex annuli (VAs) with large values of topological charge S (giant VAs) are not only a subject of fundamental interest, but are also sought for various applications, such as quantum information processing and storage.</S0> <S1> However, in conventional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) VAs with S > 1 are unstable.</S1> <S2> Here, we demonstrate that robust self-trapped fundamental solitons (with S = 0) and bright VAs (with the stability checked up to S = 5), can be created in the free space by means of the local-field effect (the feedback of the BEC on the propagation of electromagnetic waves) in a condensate of two-level atoms coupled by a microwave (MW) field, as well as in a gas of MW-coupled fermions with spin 1/2.</S2> <S3> The fundamental solitons and VAs remain stable in the presence of an arbitrarily strong repulsive contact interaction (in that case, the solitons are constructed analytically by means of the Thomas-Fermi approximation).</S3> <S4> Under the action of the attractive contact interaction with strength β, which, by itself, would lead to collapse, the fundamental solitons and VAs exist and are stable, respectively, at β < βmax(S) and β < βst(S), with βst(S = 0) = βmax(S = 0) and βst(S ≥ 1) < βmax(S ≥ 1).</S4> <S5> Accurate analytical approximations are found for both βst and βmax, with βst(S) growing linearly with S.</S5> <S6> Thus, higher-order VAs are more robust than their lower-order couterparts, on the contrary to what is known in other systems that may support stable self-trapped vortices.</S6> <S7> Conditions for the experimental realizations of the VAs are discussed.</S7>
