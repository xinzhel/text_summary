<S0> The current practice of shaping subscriber traffic using a token bucket filter by internet service providers may result in a severe waste of network resources in shared access networks ; except for a short period of time proportional to the size of a token bucket , it can not allocate excess bandwidth among active subscribers even when there are only a few active subscribers . to better utilize the network resources in shared access networks , therefore , we recently proposed and analyzed the performance of access traffic control schemes , which can allocate excess bandwidth among active subscribers proportional to their token generation rates . also , to exploit the excess bandwidth allocation enabled by the proposed traffic control schemes , we have been studying flexible yet practical service plans under a hybrid traffic control architecture , which are attractive to both an internet service provider and its subscribers in terms of revenue and quality of service . in this pap. </S0> <S1> We report the current status of our modeling of the hybrid traffic control schemes and service plans with omnet ++ / inet - hnrl based on ieee standard 802.1 q stacked vlans. </S1> <S2> Isp traffic control , excess bandwidth allocation , stacked vlans. </S2>
