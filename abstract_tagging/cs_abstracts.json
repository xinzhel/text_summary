", " This new approach has led to a sequence of advances , in setting and solving new mathematical challenges as well as in harnessing discrete mathematics to the task of solving real - world problems . in this ta. ", " , i will survey the development of modern cryptography the mathematics behind secret communications and protocols in this light. ", " I will describe the complexity theoretic foundations underlying the cryptographic tasks of encryption , pseudo - randomness number generators and functions , zero knowledge interactive proofs , and multi - party secure protocols. ", " I will attempt to highlight the paradigms and proof techniques which unify these foundations , and which have made their way into the mainstream of complexity theory.
